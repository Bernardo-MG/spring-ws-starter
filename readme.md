## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
